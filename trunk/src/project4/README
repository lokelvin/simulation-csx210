Project 4: Process Interaction Simulation Engine

For this project we had to design and implement a Simulation Engine based on 
the process interaction approach we learned in class. The assignment was divided 
into two parts as follows:

Design an implement a Simulation Engine that is general purpose and should work
for any relevant simulation problem. Write three applications using the engine's
API. Application descriptions were provided by the course textbook 
(Discrete-Event System Simulation: 5/e by Banks, Carson, Nelson and Nicol, 2010). 

These applications were:
 - Able-Baker Call Center: Example 3.1: Page 69
 - Grocery Store Checkout Counter: Example 3.3: Page 77
 - Dump Trucks for Hauling Coal: Example 3.5: Page 81
