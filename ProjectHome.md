This site contains code written by [Michael Cotterell](http://michaelcotterell.com) and [Robert Edger](http://robertedger.com) for [Dr. Miller's](http://cs.uga.edu/~jam/) CSCI 4210/6210 Simulation and Modeling course, taught Fall 2011 at the University of Georgia. The purpose of this site is to act as a portfolio of the work done by Michael and Robert in that course.

## Project 2: Event Scheduling Simulation Engine ##

For this project we had to design and implement a Simulation Engine based on the event scheduling approach we learned in class. The assignment was divided into two parts as follows:
  * Design an implement a Simulation Engine that is general purpose and should work for any relevant simulation problem.
  * Write three applications using the engine's API. Application descriptions were provided by the course textbook (Discrete-Event System Simulation: 5/e by Banks, Carson, Nelson and Nicol, 2010). These applications were:
    * Able-Baker Call Center: Example 3.1: Page 69
    * Grocery Store Checkout Counter: Example 3.3: Page 77
    * Dump Trucks for Hauling Coal: Example 3.5: Page 81
